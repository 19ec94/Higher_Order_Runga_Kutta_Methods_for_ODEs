\section{Template creation}

Apart from ESERK4 and ESERK5 there exists a family of ESERK algorithms for other orders such ESERK2 and ESERK6. There is also plans for developing further orders in future. This necessitates creation of an unified framework for all ESERK algorithms. \\

In the previous section the general ESERK algorithm is explained. It is interesting to note that apart from few calculations steps there is only minor differences between ESERK4 and ESERK5. \\

So the idea is, using C++ template feature, to create a ESERK template in which all order of ESERK algorithm are put together in a single file.\\
