\section{abstract}
In this project, a C++ implementation of Extrapolated Stabilized Explicit Runge-Kutta methods, in particular ESERK4 and ESERK5, originally introduced by J.Mart\'{i}n-Vaquero and A.Kleefeld, is developed. In addition to that, a C++ template which serves as an unified framework for various ESERK schemes is created. Further, in order to improve performance, manual optimizations are performed. Lastly, an attempt was made to parallelize the C++ implementation using OpenMP.
